# General standards for programming

1. Don't use non-standard commands (such as `\fp$` for `\mathfrak{p}`).
1. On the `template.sty` at the very beginning there are some customizable
   commands, like `\algcl` for the algebraic closure.
1. Preserve the maximum of 80 characters per line inside the main matter (in
   LaTeX's preface you may exceed those).
