We have tried to keep the book as similar to the original with minor changes.
Here are some changes in notation:

	$\Sigma_K$ & $M_K^0$ & Set of finite places of a number field $K$. \\
	% $D_w$ & $G_w$ & The decomposition group of a field extension $L/K$ relative to a place $w$ of $L$. \\
	$\ell$ & $\lambda$ & The residue field of a field $L$ relative to a finite place. \\
	$R^*$ & $R^\times$ & The group of units of a ring $R$. \\
	$U^\circ$ & $\Int U$ & The interior of a subset $U$ of a topological space. \\
	$A_K$ & $\mathcal{O}_K$ & The ring of algebraic integers of a number field $K$. \\
	$\operatorname{N} v$ & $\numnorm v$ & ${} = [\mathcal{O}_v : \mathfrak{m}_v].$ \\
	% $\GG_{m/K}$ & $\subbch{\GG}{m}{K}$ & The multiplicative group of $K$. \\

	% $X \times_K L$ & $X \basechg_K L$ & The base change of a $K$-scheme $X$ by a field extension $L/K$. \\
\end{longtable}

We also did some minor corrections and errata we found (the ones without
parenthesis were provided by Serre himself):
\begin{itemize}
\item (R. Schoof)
	Page~\pageref{errata:LambdaQellprime} (I-11):
	it originally said \textquote{the group ring $\Lambda = \Q_\ell[H]$},
	and it should be \textquote{$\Lambda = \Q_{\ell'}[H]$}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:Ls+m2} (I-26):
	it originally said \textquote{$L_{\rho_m}(s) = L_m^1(s - m/2)$},
	and it should be \textquote{$L_{\rho_m}(s) = L_m^1(s + m/2)$}.
\item (J.~Cuevas and R.~Sepúlveda)
	Page~\pageref{errata:follows_from_c} (II-12):
	it originally said \textquote{c), and a) follows from c)}, and it
	should be \textquote{c), and a) follows from b) and c)}.
\item (R.~Schoof)
	Page~\pageref{errata:Qp_embed} (III-3):
	it originally said \textquote{$\Gamma_K$ the set of all
	$\Q$-embeddings}, and it should be \textquote{$\Gamma_K$ the set of all
	$\Q_p$-embeddings}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:modulus21} (III-10):
	it originally said \textquote{chap.~II, 1.1}, but the correct reference
	was \ref{sec:II_21}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:refIII23} (III-13):
	it originally said \textquote{chap.~II, 2.2}, but the correct reference
	was \ref{sec:II_23}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:refIII24} (III-15):
	it originally said \textquote{chap.~II, 2.4}, but the correct reference
	was \ref{sec:II_25}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:III_prop_to_thm} (III-15):
	it originally said \textquote{The remaining assertion follows from the
	proposition}, and it should be \textquote{The remaining assertion
	follows from the theorem}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:III_rmk1_2} (III-15):
	it originally said \textquote{chapter~II, 2.5, Remark 1}, and it should
	be \textquote{chapter~II, 2.5, Remark 2}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:Kinfty} (III-29):
	it originally said \textquote{$K^\times = (K \otimes \R)^\times$}, and
	it should be \textquote{$K_\infty^\times = (K \otimes \R)^\times$}.
\item (J.~Cuevas and R.~Sepúlveda)
	Page~\pageref{errata:An+k} (III-34):
	it originally said \textquote{$A_n/A_{n+k}$}, and it should be
	\textquote{$A_n/A_{n+1}$}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:III_A2} (III-39):
	it originally said \textquote{(1) $\implies$ (2) is trivial from the
	result of A.1}, but the correct reference was \ref{sec:III_A2}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:Gal_to_Gab} (III-52):
	it originally said \textquote{let $\rho \colon G^{\rm al} \to
	\Aut(V)$}, but it should be \textquote{let $\rho \colon \Gal(\abcl K/K)
	\to \Aut(V)$}.
\item (J.~Cuevas and R.~Sepúlveda)
	Page~\pageref{errata:uv12} (IV-8):

	it originally said \textquote{by the theorem on section~4}, but the
	correct reference was \ref{sec:IV_22}.
\item Page~\pageref{errata:widetilde_Gl} (IV-19):
	it originally said \textquote{$G_\ell$ contains $\SL(2,\F_\ell)$}, but
	it should be \textquote{$\widetilde{G}_\ell$ contains
	$\SL(2,\F_\ell)$}.
% \item (R.~Schoof)
% 	Page~\pageref{errata:GL_to_SL} (IV-26):
% 	it originally said \textquote{Let $H_\ell = G \cap \GL(2, \Z_\ell)$},
% 	but it should be \textquote{Let $H_\ell = G \cap \SL(2, \Z_\ell)$}.
\end{itemize}
We also added the Cremona labels to the explicit elliptic curves in
Chap.~\ref{ch:iv}, \ref{sec:IV_33}.
