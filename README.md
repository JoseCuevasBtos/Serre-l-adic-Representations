# Serre-l-adic-Representations

This is a project for TeXing Serre's monograph "Abelian l-adic representations
and elliptic curves" (Addison-Wesley, 1989) into modern LaTeX.

This was done by José Cuevas and Rocío Sepúlveda Manzo
([magicalharuka123](https://github.com/magicalharuka123)).
We do not claim any originality of the text, aside from slightly updating the
notation (see "Editors' notes").
