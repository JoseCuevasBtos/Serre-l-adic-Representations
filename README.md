# Serre-l-adic-Representations

This is a project for TeXing Serre's monograph "Abelian l-adic representations
and elliptic curves" (Addison-Wesley, 1989) into modern LaTeX.
Currently it is finished! (Well up to typos and small TODOs).

## Configuration
We added a `Makefile` to the project, so Unix users may compile the project on
their respective machines by doing a simple `make`, and clean it afterwards
(i.e. errasing temporary files) with `make clean`.

Also, the default version attempts to mimic as much as possible the original,
but we also included some secondary custom versions.

## Credits
This was done by José Cuevas Barrientos and Rocío Sepúlveda Manzo
([magicalharuka123](https://github.com/magicalharuka123)).
We do not claim any originality of the text, aside from slightly updating the
notation (see "Editors' notes").
The content of the document is original of Jean-Pierre Serre.
